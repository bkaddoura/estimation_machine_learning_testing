Applications in Python, Chapter 3.
| Duration | Lesson Section                                 | Learning Objectives                                             |
|----------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 30 mins  | Go through the Simple Linear Regression section of the slide deck. | - Parameter estimation with least squares<br>- Assessing accuracy of parameter estimates<br>- Hypothesis testing for coefficients<br>- Checking quality of model fit with R^2 and RSE |
| 15 mins  | Go through the "Simple Linear Regression" section in the Jupyter Notebook file as a class. | - Use `sm.OLS()` to specify the model and `model.fit()` to fit a linear model to the `Boston` data set.<br>- Interpret results using `summary()`<br>- Plot model |
| 20 mins  | Go through the multiple linear regression section of the slide deck. | - Estimating and assessing fit of parameters and model<br>- Types of errors associated with predictions<br>- Prediction intervals |
| 10 mins  | Go through the "Multiple Linear Regression" section in the Jupyter Notebook file as a class. | - Use `ModelSpec()` to fit a multiple linear regression<br>- Interpret model results.<br>- Use `get_prediction()` to find a prediction interval |
| 15 mins  | Go through the "Qualitative Predictors" section of the slide deck. | - Qualitative predictors<br>- Dummy variables<br>- Two or more levels |
| 8 mins   | Go through the "Qualitative Predictors" section in the Jupyter Notebook file as a class. | - Use a qualitative predictor<br>- Interpret the coefficient estimates |
| 10 mins  | Go through the linear model extensions section of the slide deck. | - Removing the additive assumption<br>- Interaction effect<br>- Hierarchical principal |
| 5 mins   | Go through the "Interaction Term" section in the Jupyter Notebook file as a class. | - Use `ModelSpec()` and `model.fit()` with an interaction term |
| 30 mins  | Go through the remaining sections of the slide deck. | - Non-linear response-predictor relationship<br>- Correlation of error terms<br>- Non-constant variance of error terms<br>- Outliers<br>- High-leverage points |
| 20 mins  | Go through the "Helpful Plots" section in the Jupyter Notebook file as a class. Students should be given time to finish the question at the end. | - How to use plots to examine data and fit<br>- Plot studentized residuals<br>- Cumulative exercise |


Before we get started this week please review the following materials, we will be spending the bulk of our first class getting up to speed on some foundational statistical concepts covered in the materials below. Please spend some time ahead of our first class on these materials and bring any questions you may have to class / tutorial.

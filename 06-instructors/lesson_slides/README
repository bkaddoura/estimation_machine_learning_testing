First slides were developed by Simone Collier under the supervision of Rohan Alexander. Slides have been created and modified by Navona Calarco and Julia Gallucci for Winter 2023. This course pulls largely from the book, An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R (2nd edition, 2021), by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani.
